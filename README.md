## Introduction

This repository is a compilation of Java exercises organized to demonstrate my learning journey. The exercises are carefully crafted to cover different levels of difficulty, ensuring a comprehensive overview of my Java programming skills.

## Tasks and Exercises

### 1. Hello, World!
- Exercise 1: Create a simple Java program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console.

### 2. Variables and Data Types
- Exercise 2: Declare variables for different data types (int, double, String) and perform basic arithmetic operations.
- Exercise 3: Concatenate strings and explore string manipulation.
- Exercise 4: Explore type conversion by converting variables from one data type to another.

### 3. Control Flow - Conditional Statements
- Exercise 5: Implement a program that checks if a given number is even or odd.
- Exercise 6: Create a program that determines if a year is a leap year.
- Exercise 7: Create a program that calculates the average of three exam scores and assigns a grade based on standard grading criteria. Includes input validation for scores within the valid range (0 to 100).

### 4. Loops
- Exercise 8: Implement a Java program to print the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.
- Exercise 9: Create a Simple 'Guess the Number' game implemented in Java using a loop.
- Exercise 10: Java program to generate and display prime numbers up to a user-specified limit.
- Exercise 11: write a Java program to print a pyramid pattern of numbers based on user-defined height.

### 5. Arrays
- Exercise 12: Enhance Matrix Multiplication program to handle invalid inputs, prompting the user for valid numeric entries.
- Exercise 13: Implement Java program using the quicksort algorithm to sort an array of integers in ascending order.
- Exercise 14: Java program to find the maximum and minimum values in an array.
- Rxercise 15: Java program to reverse the elements of an array without using built-in functions.

### 6. Methods And Functions
- Exercise 16: Implement Polynomial class with operations (addition, subtraction, evaluation) and a program showcasing its usage.
- Exercise 17: Implement palindrome checker function for strings, ensuring efficient and accurate verification.
- Exercise 18: Add a Java program to calculate the factorial of a number, providing a fundamental mathematical utility.

### 7. OOP - Classes and Objects
- Exercise 19: Introduce a Library Management System with modularized classes: Book, LibraryMember, and LibraryManagementSystem. Each class encapsulates specific functionalities, promoting maintainability and readability. The system allows displaying available books and library members, borrowing and returning books, and gracefully handles user interactions through a menu-driven interface. This commit establishes a foundation for a scalable and organized library management solution.
- Exercise 20: The Inventory Management System is a Java-based application designed to facilitate efficient management of product inventory in various domains. This system provides a robust foundation for tracking, organizing, and updating product information, allowing businesses to streamline their inventory operations. I published this project in a seperate repository also.

### 8. Exception Handling
- Exercise 21: Write a program that handles exceptions (e.g., divide by zero) using try-catch blocks.
- Exercise 22: Create a custom exception class and handle it in your program.
- Exercise 23: The "File and Exception Handling in Java" project is designed to showcase effective techniques for managing files and handling exceptions in Java programming. The project provides practical examples of reading data from files, performing operations, and addressing potential errors through exception handling mechanisms.

### 9. File I/0 operations
- Exercise 24: Reads student data from a file and displays details for each student.
- Exercise 25: Writes student data to a file, demonstrating the process of updating the file content.
- Exercise 26: Implementation of the Student Record Management System with functionalities for displaying, adding, updating, and deleting student records, file I/O operations, and a menu-driven interface.

### 10. Collections - Lists and Maps
- Exercise 27: Implement a program (ListManager.java) that utilizes a list to manage a collection of items with functionalities such as adding, displaying, removing, and clearing items from the list.
- Exercise 28: Create a program (SimpleDictionary.java) that acts as a simple dictionary using a map, allowing users to add words with translations, translate words, and display the dictionary content.

### 11. Multithreading
- Exercise 29: Implement a program representing Basic Multithreading 
- Exercise 30: Implement a Synchronized Counter program to avoid race conditions
- Exercise 31: This program simulates a bank scenario where multiple customers (threads) are making random deposits and withdrawals from a shared bank account. The BankAccount class is synchronized to avoid race conditions when updating the balance.

### 12. Networking
- Exercise 32: Demonstrate Networking in java by implementing a basic client-server application using sockets.

### 13. JavaFX GUI 
- Exercise 33: Design and implement a simple GUI application where you can input your name and be greeted.
- Exercise 34: Extend GUI application for Exercise 33 by handling user input and performing actions
